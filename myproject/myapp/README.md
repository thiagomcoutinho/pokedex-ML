features with BIC extractor.

- knn_model_train.py: File that trains knn with pre-set parameters obtained by GridSearch(sklearn) and returns model.

- predictClass.py: Call knn_model_train.py to train model and imports feature vector generated by BIC in prepareDataBase.py . 
Returns the predicted class to views.py .
